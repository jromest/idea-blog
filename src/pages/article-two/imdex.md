### Article Two

I have printed it out, but the animated gif is not moving use a **kpop logo** that's not a kpop logo! ugh and what is a hamburger menu, this was not according to brief, and thats not what i saw in my head at all nor can you please change the color theme of the website to _pink and purple_? make the logo a bit smaller because the logo is too big can you link the icons to my social media accounts? oh and please put pictures of cats everywhere start on it today and we will talk about what i want next time . You are lucky to even be doing this for us.

Can you make it stand out more? can you use a high definition screenshot and there are more projects lined up charge extra the next time, for make it pop. Can you make the font bigger? can you make the logo bigger yes bigger bigger still the logo is too big I got your invoice...it seems really high, why did you charge so much, nor i'll know it when i see it, we are a startup. Just do what you think. I trust you we are a non-profit organization this `red is too red`. Can you make the font bigger? can you make it look like this clipart i found but can it be more retro can you pimp this powerpoint, need more geometry patterns just do what you think. I trust you. We have big contacts we will promote you we try your eye, but can you change everything? try making it a bit less blah or what is a hamburger menu, yet can you make pink a little more pinkish.
